# Intelligent-Safety-Driving-Vechicle

Initially, starting from capturing the frames from the driving environment.
Then converting the captured image frame from RGB to Grayscale. 
From the converted gray scale image, obtaining information about edges of the path and to detect objects (obstacles) in front of the vehicle.
From the edges of the path detected and the objects captured training the vehicle accordingly using Neural network. 
Recording these sets of data and from this recorded sets of data the vehicle drives on its own.
